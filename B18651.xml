            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the Commoners of the Mannor of <hi>Epworth</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Axhelme</hi> in the County of <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A Bill being brought into the Honourable House of Commons reciting the Statutes of <hi>Merton</hi> and <hi>Westm;</hi> the 2d, against pulling down and destroying Fences of approved Grounds, by unknown Persons in the Night: And further reciting, That divers evil disposed Persons are grown so impudently Bold of late, that they not only in the Night time burn, pull down, waste and destroy Houses, Fences of Approvement, and other Things; but also in Multitudes armed and disguised in such manner as they may not be known, in the Day-time commit the same Offences, in Contempt of the Law, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable wrong and damage of many of his Majesties Subjects; and the Towns adjoyning will not apprehend such Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and bring them to punishment: Wherefore it is prayed that it may be enacted, That if any Person disguised do in the Day-time destroy any such Fences or Corn, and the Towns next adjoyning do not upon Notice given to the Constable, or other Chief Officer, Apprehend and cause to be brought to punishment such Offenders within a reasonable time; That such Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship next adjoyning for every such neglect, shall be distreined to levy and make up at their proper charge such Hedges and Ditches, and answer Damages to the Party or Parties, in like manner as Towns neglecting to Indict such as are guilty of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down Fences in the Night are by the said former Statutes to be distreined; and answer Damages.</p>
            <p>Please to observe, That although this Bill is brought in as a Publick Bill, for the good of the whole Kingdom, yet it is brought in by the promotion of <hi>Nathaniel Reading</hi> Esq; and purely for his own private ends, and to prejudice the Inhabitants of the said Mannor of <hi>Epworth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Please to observe, That the Statute of <hi>Westm</hi> 2.13 <hi>Edw.</hi> I. cap. 46. saith, That the Statute of <hi>Merton</hi> shall not only bind the Lords Tenemants, but Neighbours which claim Common: But if any claim Common by special Feoffment, or Grant for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Beasts, or otherwise which is due to him of Common Right, he shall recover the same according to the Form of such Grant.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> III. Lord <hi>Mowbray</hi> was Lord of <hi>Epworth</hi> Mannor: And he then made an Approvement of a great part of the Wasts and Commons belonging to that Mannor: And his Tenants complaining thereof to him, to the end that he and his Heirs, and all future Lords, might be debarred from making any further Approvements, by his Grant or Charter dated 1 <hi>May</hi> 33 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. did grant, That he or his Heirs, would make no further Approvement of any part of the residue of the said Commons;</p>
            <p>The said Mannor of <hi>Epworth</hi> came to the Crown in Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> time. The Common or Wasts of <hi>Epworth</hi> contain 13400 Acres.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the First coming to be Lord of this Mannor of <hi>Epworth,</hi> by the insinuation of some cunning Men, was prevailed upon to Approve and Inclose 7400 Acres, part of the said Waste, and left but 6000 to the Commoners, who are a numerous People; four large Parishes of a great circumference: And the whole Common left by <hi>Mowbray</hi> was scarce sufficient for them.</p>
            <p>The said King <hi>Charles</hi> I. in the 11th year of his Reign, granted the said 7400 Acres to some Persons who call themselves Participants.</p>
            <p>As this Case is, King <hi>Charles</hi> could not Approve any part for two Reasons: First, Because there was no Surplusage. 2ly. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Mowbray</hi> their former Lord, had approved part; and made the said Deed of the residue; which debars all future Lords from making any further Approvement, in that the Law is clear.</p>
            <p>Some time after the said pretended Approvement was made, several Trials were had both at Bar and at the Assizes, between the said Commoners and Participants about the said 7400 Acres: And the Commoners having obtained many Verdicts, at the last the said Participants wholly left the said 7400 Acres; and the Commoners have for most part enjoyed the same.</p>
            <p>Till the said Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> having by some ill practices, lately gotten into possession of some part of the said 7400 Acres, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed the same about two years ago; and some Commoners threw down some of his Fences; for which he brought his Writ, <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#murp" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rounded on the said Statute of <hi>Westm</hi> 2. And the Commoners in <hi>Easter</hi> Term last pleaded in Justification their Title of Right of Common: And Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> hath not yet proceeded to Try the same, being sufficiently satisfied of the said Commoners Right thereto: And that their Right to the said 7400 Acres has been often affirmed by many Trials, both at the Bar and at the Assizes.</p>
            <p>That in case this Bill should pass into an Act, it would be severe on all Towns, and especially on the Inhabitants of this Mannor of <hi>Epworth,</hi> their Commons lying many Miles in length: Insomuch that a constant Watch of less than One Hundred Persons, could not secure the Fences: And in case such Watch should be kept for that purpose, yet in misty Days Fences may be thrown down, and the Watch not see them.</p>
            <p>That the said Commoners of <hi>Epworth</hi> have great reason to believe, that the said Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> hath so great prejudice to them, that in case this Bill passes into an Act, he will by himself or his Servants, when he or they see the Coast clear, and that they are not seen, pull down the Fences themselves (as he hath often already done, or caused to be done, and charged it on the Commoners) on purpose to damnifie them.</p>
            <p>So that the said Commoners have great reason to fear, that in case this Bill passes into an Act, it will tend to the utter ruine of the Inhabitants of this Mannor of <hi>Epworth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the Inhabitants of the said Mannor of <hi>Epworth</hi> do humbly pray, that in case it shall be conceived, that this Bill may be for the publick good of this Kingdom, That there may be a Proviso therein inserted, (That it shall not extend to any part of the Commons or Waste of <hi>Epworth</hi> Mannor, or Inclosures made, or to be made therein, in regard the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners there Claim by Grant.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or otherwise, <hi>That the said Bill may not pass.</hi>
            </p>
